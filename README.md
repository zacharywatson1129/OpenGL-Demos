# OpenGL-Demos
Modern OpenGL demonstrations of features such as shaders, transformations, coordinate systems, etc. Uses GLFW and Glad.
Demos follow tutorials from this book: https://learnopengl.com/book/book_pdf.pdf (my sole reason for choosing GLFW and Glad), focusing on the first part of that book.
The book is also available as a print book, and online as webpages, https://learnopengl.com/. Thank you kindly to the author for making it freely available.
I have made very few modifications to the demonstrations (not to say they are copy-pastes of the solutions provided for the book, they are mostly my own code, where I solved some of the exercises. They are very similar, however). I have attempted to add explanations of key parts of the code in a README file in each demo's folder. I also will paste the terminal command to compile the code, or at least the commands that worked for my particular configuration in Ubuntu 20.04.
Note: Some examples are written in C, some are written in C++. The later tutorials are written pretty much all in C++ because GLM is C++ only, and while there is CGLM, it's just easier to use GLM, however the code is really C code, with the very few C++-y things added in, such as including <iostream>, and things like that.
