triangleDemo

This demo demonstrates how to create a simple triangle, and shows off the basic components of a modern OpenGL application, including a vertex shader, fragment shader, VBO, VAO, etc.

One version utilizes GLUT, the other uses GLFW and Glad. Other than that, they should be almost identitical.
